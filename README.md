🚀 Born with a love for technology and raised in the digital realm, I've journeyed from ZX Spectrum adventures to mastering cloud architecture on the world's stage. 

A wizard in the cloud, I wield [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) like a spellbook and dance with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) like a master choreographer. When not crafting resilient solutions or delving into distributed systems, you'll find me gliding through code like a tango dancer 💃 or roaring across the digital highways on my [Triumph](https://www.triumphmotorcycles.pt/) 🏍️.

Join me on GitHub and let's code the future together! ✨
